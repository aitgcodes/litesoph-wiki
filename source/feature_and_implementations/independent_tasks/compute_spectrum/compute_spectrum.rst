**Calculation of absorption spectrum** 
Performs the Fourier Transformation of dipole-dipole autocorrelation to calculate 
oscillator strength and plots the absortion Spectrum. Plotting requires the following input:

**1. Energy step (in eV):** Steps/interval of Energy axis at which the oscillator strengths 
are interpolated.

**1. Minimum & Maximum Energy (in eV):** X-axis (Energy in eV) range for plotting.

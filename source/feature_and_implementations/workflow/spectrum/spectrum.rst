The Workflow for the calculations of spectrum is as follows:

**1.** Start the workflow with ground state calculation. See :ref:`GS`.

**2.** After the ground state calculation is done, proceed to RT-TDDFT calculation. See :ref:`rt-tddft`.

**3.** After RT-TDDFT calculation is done, proceed to compute spectrum. See :ref:`compute-spectrum`.

**4.** For post processing and and visualization, see :ref:`pp-visualization`

Development workflow
====================


Setting up your local repository
================================

1. Fork the LITESOPH/litesoph repo into your github account.

2. ``git clone`` this newly forked repo into your local machine.


Setting up your development environment
=======================================

You can make the virtual environment using either ``conda`` or ``python-venv``.
The steps to create an environment through these methods are listed below.

Conda environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Step-1: Download Anaconda_ package manager.

Step-2: Install Anaconda_ in the HOME directory.

Step-3: Create new virtual environment(say test-lite):: 

 $ conda create -n test-lite python=3.7.6

Step-4: Activate the test-lite environment:: 

 $ conda activate test-lite

Step-5: Install litesoph in an editable mode:: 

 $ pip install -e <path litesoph package>

Python venv environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Step-1: Check Python version::

 $ python --version

Step-2: If it is <3.7.6 upgrade the Python version to 3.7.6 if possible else use conda environment.

Step-3: Create a new virtual environment (say test-lite)::

 $ python -m venv test-lite

Step-4: Activate the test-lite environment::

 $ source ~/test-lite/bin/activate

Step-5: Install litesoph in a editable mode:: 

 $ pip install -e <path to litesoph package>


Coding Standards
================
The LITESOPH project adheres to PEP-8 guidelines for writing code in Python. 
The PEP-8 guidelines and the advantages of using this system are explained 
in a clear and concise manner in an article published by `Real Python <https://realpython.com/python-pep8/>`_. 
For more information refer to the original  `PEP-8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ document.

LITESOPH Job Submission, Monitoring and File Management
========================================================

LITESOPH Job Submission, Monitoring and File Management is a set of modules capable of handling tasks like submission of job to remote machine, tracking the status running job and transferring of files from remote to local machine.   

Features
========

1. Job Submission module supports queue (qsub, sbatch etc) as well as non-queue (bash) based job submission on remote machine through password and passwordless approach. Passwordless approach is generally used to avoid typing password repeatively for every job submission. It can also help to bypass captcha based login authentication. See :doc:`/./FAQs/pwless-ssh`

2. Monitoring and File Management modules handles the job of tracking the status as well as terminating the  running job on remote machine. File Management module handles the downloading of all files as well as selective transfer the files from remote to local machine via different transfer methods (direct transfer along with compression and split transfer).

Functionalities
================

1. Function to submit a job at local as well as remote machine

2. Function to check the running status of job submitted at local machine as well as remote machine  

3. Function to get the information about files generated by running project at local as well as remote machine.

4. Function to view different files generated by running job at local as well as remote machine.

5. Function to kill running job at remote machine.

6. Function to selectively transfer files with varying methods (direct, compress, split).


Modules, Functions and Working
===============================
LITESOPH Job Submission, Runtime Query and File Management modules depends on two main Functionalities. Function to make connection with remote machine and execute commands on it via password as well as passwordless login authentication. 

Furthermore, Runtime Query and File Management uses mainly four modules to work: 

* Module **litesoph/common/submit.py** handles methods requires to establish connection between local and remote machine, submitting jobs at local and remote machine, and downloading files. 

* Module **litesoph/common/lfm_database.py** defines are all predefined rules, methods and database required for file management and query related Functionalities.  

* Module **litesoph/gui/task_controller.py** handles methods related to runtime query for local as well as remote job submission.

* Module **litesoph/gui/views.py** handles the GUI for all backend Functionalities related to LITESOPH Job Submission, Runtime Query and File Management.
